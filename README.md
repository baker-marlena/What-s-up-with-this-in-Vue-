# whats-up-with-this

> A Vue.js project for playing around with `this` binding and function declarations. Open the code, follow the below up to `npm run dev`, and then comment/uncomment the method invocations in `mounted`. The message on the page will apear when `this` is bound to the Vue Component and dissapear when it's bound incorrectly. The entirety of `this` is logged to the console for each method to confirm where it is bound. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
